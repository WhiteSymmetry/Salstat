Salstat revitalised

This is not Salstat 2 (see https://code.google.com/p/salstat-statistics-package-2/ and try it!).

I've done no work on this for about 10 years only to find that people are *still* using it. I'm surprised at its longevity and wonder if, just maybe, I should continue developing it.

INSTALLATION (Windows):

The Windows executable installs like any other application. Download it and
run the executable to install it. You will be given options like having a
desktop icon, a menu entry, links to the web pages and so on. The Python 
source code is also included.

INSTALLATION (Linux executable):

This is in some ways more complex, but in other ways easier. Unpack the archive
('gunzip salstat*' then 'tar -xvf salstat*') and everything will open into a 
directory called salstat. If you wish, you can place the directory in /usr/share or
somewhere in your home directory. The file called (simply) 'salstat' is the 
executable, but you may wish to write a short bash script to call the main 
executable. There is also an icon file which can be used for KDE or
Gnome shortcuts if required. The Python source code is also included.

INSTALLATION - Linux/Unix and Windows (source code):

Open the archive using tar/gunzip for packages ending in tar.gz, or something
like WinZip for zip archives. There should be a core of files which you need
to put somewhere. As you have wxPython installed, I recommend going to the
wxPython directory, and putting them into a directory somewhere. Open a
console/DOS box, and change to that directory. Then (assuming Python and
wxPython has installed properly), run "python salstat.py".

INSTALLATION - Mac OSX:

Thanks to Ludger Humbert who has OSX and tried the following:

at first anyone who wants to install it has to
install a X-Server on the Mac OS X

I recommend installing all the software with fink, it's available via
http://fink.sourceforge.net/

The second was taken while running Orobor. One can get it on
http://wrench.et.ic.ac.uk/adrian/software/oroborosx/

This Window-Manager integrates with look and feel very fine into
the native Mac OS X -- Aqua Windowmanager


**WARNING** - this is beta software - DO NOT RELY UPON THIS FOR RESEARCH -
there is a lot of testing to do before its accuracy can be verified, so the
results that come out of this may not be any good at all. 

It may crash and ruin your data, trash your hard disk, kill you, burn your
house down, run off with your life partner, and end the world as we know it.
Well, you never know ;), so MAKE BACKUPS BEFORE USING IT!
